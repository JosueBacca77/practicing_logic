cd(dirName): receive a folder name and takes the user there. Also, is the parameter is “..”, it has to come back to the parent.

touch(fileName): receive a file name and creates it in the folder the user is in
ls(): list the files and folders in the folder the user is in

mkdir(dirName): receive a folder name and creates it in the folder the user is in

pwd(): print the path the user is in
